If you want to play there are 2 options.

The first option is to play on the console where the pieces are tiny images and in order to move a 
piece you need to input the start position and the end position.

The second option which is much cooler is to play the GUI version of the Chess where you play on an actual board and 
in order to move a piece you just need to click on the piece and then click on where you want to put it, just as like as Chess.com.
