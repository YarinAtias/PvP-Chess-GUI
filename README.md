If you want to play there are 2 options.

The first option is to play on the console where the pieces are represented by their first letter and in order to move a 
piece you need to input the start position and the end position. if you want to play this please 
open the chess directory, open the file named 'chess_console.py' and run it.

The second option which is much cooler is to play the GUI version of the Chess where you play on an actual board and 
in order to move a piece you just need to click on the piece and then click on where you want to put it, just as like as Chess.com.
if you would like to play on this version, please open the again the chess directory, open the file named 'chess_gui.py' and run it.
